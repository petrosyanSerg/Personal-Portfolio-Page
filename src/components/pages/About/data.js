	text: `I am a beginner front-end developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites. My goal is to create websites that not only look great but also provide a seamless user experience.
	In my portfolio, you will find examples of websites that I have designed and developed using various front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project showcases my skills in layout design, color theory, typography, and user interface design.
	I am constantly learning and exploring new front-end technologies to improve my skills and create better websites. I am particularly interested in responsive design and accessibility, ensuring that my websites are usable and accessible for everyone, regardless of their abilities or devices.
	In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong communicator and collaborator. I believe that communication is key to any successful project and enjoy working closely with clients and team members to ensure that their vision is realized.
	Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio website. If you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential project, please don't hesitate to contact me.`,
